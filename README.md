# mentemedia
mentemedia-- put a whole bunch of .html files in ../mentemedia-data/items and they will be loaded in using a single PHP backend file and the magic of jquery.
There is no security, this is intended for personal use on a local LAMP server. You might want to use .htaccess to block remote clients.
You might also want to use ../mentemedia-data/images and ../mentemedia-data/infobox-templates to make infoboxes. And you can use ../mentemedia-data/redirects.json to setup redirects within the loader. The loader is all in the .js file.
